This is for when you have a portion of your users that will be moving to a new exchange environment for Unified Messaging in Unity Connections.
This will take a full export from UCXN, compare a list of emails that will be moving over, select those users and put them in a new set of files.
Those can then be used by BAT Admin Tools in UCXN to remove UM settings for the selected users, then create the new UM settings for the users.


1. Export all users in UCXN that have UM as full-export.csv.
2. Create CSV from email list provided by administrator as email-exchange.csv.
3. Make sure filenames match the names of the examples EXACTLY.
4. Run python script.
5. Use final-delete.csv (was created by the python script) and "delete" "unified message" settings for all users called out in the file. This is performed under bat tools in UCXN.
 a. This will delete the UM setting for the users that are matched in the email-exchange.csv and also the full-export.csv.
6. Use final-create.csv (was created by the python script) and "create" "unified message" settings for all users called out in the file. This is performed under bat tools in UCXN.
7. Verify users that are in the final-create.csv now have Unified Messaging for the new Unified Messaging Exchange connection.
