This is the python script that will run and take a list of current exported users in Unity Connection that have UM, it will compare a list of emails provided that need to move to the new UM, clean it up, then add it to a new csv file. 

1. Export all users in UCXN that have UM as full-export.csv.
2. Create CSV from email list provided by administrator as email-exchange.csv.
3. Make sure filenames match the names of the examples EXACTLY.
4. Run python script.
5. Use final-delete.csv (was created by the python script) and "delete" "unified message" settings for all users called out in the file. This is performed under bat tools in UCXN.
 a. This will delete the UM setting for the users that are matched in the email-exchange.csv and also the full-export.csv.
6. Use final-create.csv (was created by the python script) and "create" "unified message" settings for all users called out in the file. This is performed under bat tools in UCXN.
7. Verify users that are in the final-create.csv now have Unified Messaging for the new Unified Messaging Exchange connection.
